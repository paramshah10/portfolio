      Born and brought up in India, I am currently half way around the world with the opportunity of studying in the U.S.
      I am currently a sophomore pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at the <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.cs.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Los Angeles</a>
      where I have been inducted into the prestigous computer science honor society, <a class="underline-link" href="https://upe.seas.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Upsilon Pi Epsilon</a>,
      as a result of my academic achievements.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably playing soccer, at the beach,
      or hanging out with my friends.
